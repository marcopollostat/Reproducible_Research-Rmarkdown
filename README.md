# Reproducible_Research-Rmarkdown

## Objective

This project aims to apply good practices in the dissemination of scientific research results using R, RMarkdown and RPubs (web publishing).


## Some important comments

* Replication can be difficult and often there are no resources to independently replicate a study.

* Reproducibility, whereby data and code are re-analyzed by independent scientists to obtain the same results of the original investigator, is a reasonable minimum standard when replication is not possible.

* The process of conducting and disseminating research can be depicted as a “data science pipeline”.

* Readers and consumers of data science research are typically not privy to the details of the data science pipeline.

* One view of reproducibility is that it gives research consumers partial access to the raw pipeline elements.

## Outline

This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) storm database. Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. To prevent such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern. The dataset presents the 1950 to 2011 period.
