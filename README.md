# Reproducible_Research-Rmarkdown
## Outline

This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s (NOAA) storm database. Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. To prevent such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern. The dataset presents the 1950 to 2011 period.

Based on the documentation of the dataset, one investigates the main events which cause harm to Health (injuries and fatalities) and Economic Field (properties and crops).
